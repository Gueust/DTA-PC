- Add the nodes previous to the origin links as origin in the mutable graph
("addSingleBufferSource")
- Add the nodes without outgoing links to the list of destinations 
("SingleBufferDestination type")

- Gives the values to the fundamental diagram of cells:
* Add the alues at the link level
* Includes it into cells when discretizing the graph

- Add the paths to the graph (takes the list of PATH links and transform it into
JB-links (call the PATHLink_to_links hasmap)

- Add the demand:
* Transform the history of demand into a the discretization given for the 
problem (look at generalNetwork.data.demand FunctionGraph)
* Then add it to the LWR_Network
-Add the split ratios to the LWR_network:
* Create a new IntertemporalSplitRatios that will need to be filled by and using
IntertemporalJunctionSplitRatios. In IntertemporalJunctionSplitRatios, there are
the functions addNonCompliantSplitRatio and addCompliantSplitRatio to do so.
